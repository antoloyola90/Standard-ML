<H3>Installing Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ)<br><br></h3>
<p><b>Mac OS X</b>
<ol>
<li> Navigate to <a href="http://smlnj.org/dist/working/110.77/index.html">http://smlnj.org/dist/working/110.77/index.html</a>.
<li> In the section that says "MacOS X", click on the link to "smlnj-x86-110.77.pkg". That file will be downloaded.
<li> On your computer (in the folder into which the file was downloaded), double-click on the
downloaded file (smlnj-x86-110.77.pkg). Follow the instructions, accepting the default settings 
as you go.
<li> The sml executable is /usr/local/smlnj/bin/sml .  If you include "/usr/local/smlnj/bin" in your PATH environment variable, you can just type "sml" in a shell to run it.  Alternatively, in your .bashrc file, you can put "alias sml=/usr/local/smlnj/bin/sml", in which case you can also type "sml" in a shell to run it.
<li> To exit the SML interpreter, type control-D.
</ol>

<p><b>Cygwin on Windows</b>
<ol>
<li> Navigate to <a href="http://smlnj.org/dist/working/110.77/index.html">http://smlnj.org/dist/working/110.77/index.html</a>.
<li> In the section that says "Microsoft Windows", click on the link to "smlnj-110.77.msi" to download the installation package.
<li> In the same web page in the same section, click on the "WININSTALL" link and read the instructions.
<li> On your computer (in the directory in which the file was downloaded), double-click on the
downloaded file (smlnj-110.77.msi) to perform the installation process.
<li> The sml.bat file, which invokes the SML interpreter, is in c:/Program Files/SMLNJ/bin. When you run cygwin, this directory should already be in your path.  To run the SML interpreter, type "sml.bat".  Alternatively, put the line "alias sml=sml.bat" in your .bashrc file and then subsequently just type "sml".
<li> To exit the SML interpreter: type control-Z, then enter.
</ol>

<p><b>Linux</b>
<ol>
<li> Navigate to <a href="http://smlnj.org/dist/working/110.77/index.html">http://smlnj.org/dist/working/110.77/index.html</a>.
<li> Follow the instructions in the "Unix" section on near the top of the page, and click on 
the link that says "config.tgz" to download that file. Put the file in a directory where
you will want SML to be installed (you can do it under your home directory or in
/usr/local/smlnj, or example).
<li> In a shell, in the directory you downloaded the file to, unpack the file by typing "tar -xzvf config.tgz", and then type 
"config/install.sh". 
<ul>
<li> If you are running a 64-bit version of Linux, you may get an error message about
SML requiring 32-bit support. In this case, click on the link in the above web page 
(in the same section) that says "INSTALL" and scroll down to the instructions
under the heading "3.2. The install fails with a message about 32-bit support".
</ul>
<li> Once it is installed, either make sure the bin/ subdirectory under whatever directory
you've installed SML into (e.g. /usr/local/smlnj), is in your PATH.
<li> To invoke the SML interpreter in a shell, type "sml".
<li> To exit the SML interpreter, type control-D.
</ol>
